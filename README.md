# CS 190 Problem Set #1&mdash;Drawing a 15-Digit Display

Course Home Page: http://physics.stmarys-ca.edu/classes/CS190_S16/index.html

Due: Before class, Tuesday, February 16th, 2016.

## Directions Specific to this Problem Set

1. The first step is to get a working copy of this repository. This breaks down into two smaller steps: forking and then cloning the repository. If your browser is pointed at https://github.com/brianhill/cs190-ps1, and you are logged in using your github account, you will see a fork button near the upper-right-hand corner of the web page. Just click it to create the fork. Then, to create the clone, open a shell (the app is called Terminal.app). If you have never worked in a shell, don't worry, below are the commands step by step. The stuff you type is the stuff following each $ sign:
```
~$ mkdir ~/Classwork
~$ cd ~/Classwork
~/Classwork$ git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username_goes_here>/cs190-ps1
Cloning into 'cs190-ps1'...
remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
remote: Total 10 (delta 2), reused 10 (delta 2), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
~/Classwork$ cd cs190-ps1/
~/Classwork/cs190-ps1 $ open *.xcodeproj
```

## General Directions for all Problem Sets

1. Fork this repository to create a repository in your own Github account. Then clone your fork to whatever machine you are working on. More detailed directions on this step and the last step are given above.
2. These problem sets are created with the latest version of Xcode and Mac OS X: XCode 7.2 and OS X 10.11.3. Do not run beta versions of Apple's software. During the term, we may move to XCode 7.3, depending on Apple's release schedule.
3. Under no circumstances copy-and-paste any part of a solution from another student in the class.
4. Under no circumstances ask outsiders on Stack Exchange or other programmers' forums to help you create a solution.
5. It is however fine&mdash;when you are truly stuck&mdash;to ask others to help you with your solution, provided you do all the typing. They should only be looking over your shoulder and commenting.
6. Commit your changes to your fork of the repository. I should be able to make a clone of your fork, and then build and execute it in my environment without modification.

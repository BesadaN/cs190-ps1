CS 190 Problem Set #1 -- Drawing a 15-Digit Display

## Directions Specific to this Problem Set

## General Directions for all Problem Sets

1. Fork this repository to create a repository in your own Github account. If your browser is pointed at https://github.com/brianhill/cs190-ps1, and you are logged in using your github account, you will see a fork button near the upper-right-hand corner of hte web page. Just click it to create the fork.
2. These problem sets are created with XCode 7.2 and OS X 10.11.3 and are tested on an iPhone running iOS 9.2.1. Do not run beta versions of any of this software. During the term, we may move to XCode 7.3 and iOS 9.3, depending on Apple's release schedule.
3. Under no circumstances copy-and-paste any part of a solution from another student in the class.
4. Under no circumstances ask outsiders on Stack Exchange or other programmers' forums to help you create a solution.
5. It is however, fine when you are truly stuck to ask others to help you with your solution, provided you do all the typing. They should just be looking over your shoulder and commenting.
6. When you are done, email me a link to your repository. I should be able to download your solution, build it and run it in my environment, and deploy it to my phone without modification.
